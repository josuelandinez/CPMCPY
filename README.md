## Overview

It is a Constrained Path Aulxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo code in python for the Hubbard model. It could be used with any version of python>=2.7 and numpy.  

The source code have the same structure that CPMC-Lab adapted to python, the npz are numpy binary compressed files to save the data the total energy and other parameters of the simulation.
